01. Write a program to read and display a 2D array of strings in C language. Use         user-defined Functions to Perform these Tasks. 
    
02. Write a program to search a string in the list of strings. Use user-defined Functions  to Perform these Tasks. 
    
03. Write a program to find the number of vowels in each of the N strings stored in two 
    dimensional arrays, taken from the user. Use user-defined Functions to Perform these Tasks. 
    
04. Write a program to sort N city names stored in two dimensional arrays, taken from 
    the user. Use user-defined Functions to Perform these Tasks. 
    
05. Suppose we have a list of email addresses, check whether all email addresses have 
    ‘@’ in it. Print the odd email out. Use user-defined Functions to Perform these Tasks. 
    
06. Write a program to print the strings which are palindrome in the list of strings. Use user-defined Functions to Perform these Tasks.
    
07. From the list of IP addresses, check whether all ip addresses are valid. Use user-defined Functions to Perform these Tasks. 
    
08. Given a list of words followed by two words, the task is to find the minimum distance 
    between the given two words in the list of words. ( Example : s = {“the”,”quick”,”brown”,”fox”,”quick”} word1 = “the”, word2 = “fox”, OUTPUT : 1 ). Use Functions to Perform these Tasks. 
    
09. Write a program that asks the user to enter a username. If the username entered is 
    one of the names in the list then the user is allowed to calculate the factorial of a 
    number. Otherwise, an error message is displayed. Use Functions to Perform these Tasks. 
    
10. Write a c program that take password as input from user hiddenly. Display Asterisk '*' when user enter password. Use Functions to Perform these Tasks. 

11. Create an authentication system that can manage 10 users. It should be menu driven. Do not use Structure and Union. Use Functions to Perform these Tasks.
